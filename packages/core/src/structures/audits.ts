/**
 * Audit Logs Resource
 *
 * When an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the VIEW_AUDIT_LOG permission and can be fetched by apps using the GET /guilds/{guild.id}/audit-logs endpoint, or seen by users in the guild's Server Settings. All audit log entries are stored for 45 days.
 *
 * When an app is performing an eligible action using the APIs, it can pass an X-Audit-Log-Reason header to indicate why the action was taken. More information is in the audit log entry section.
 *
 * @see {@link https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/audit-log#audit-logs-resource}

 * Audit Log Entry Structure
 *
 * Each audit log entry represents a single administrative action (or event), indicated by action_type. Most entries contain one to many changes in the changes array that affected an entity in Discordâ€”whether that's a user, channel, guild, emoji, or something else.
 *
 * The information (and structure) of an entry's changes will be different depending on its type. For example, in MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE events there is only one change: a member is either added or removed from a specific role. However, in CHANNEL_CREATE events there are many changes, including (but not limited to) the channel's name, type, and permission overwrites added. More details are in the change object section.
 *
 * Apps can specify why an administrative action is being taken by passing an X-Audit-Log-Reason request header, which will be stored as the audit log entry's reason field. The X-Audit-Log-Reason header supports 1-512 URL-encoded UTF-8 characters. Reasons are visible to users in the client and to apps when fetching audit log entries with the API.
